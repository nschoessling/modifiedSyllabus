    <b>Course Grade:</b><br>
    The course grade will be based on the following:</p>
    <table style = "width:50%">

    </table>
    <p><b>Grading Policies:</b>
    No late assignments will be accepted. It is vastly preferable to
    submit a partially complete assignment on time than to turn in a late assignment.
    <br>
    Similarly, it is vastly more beneficially to turn in a programming or lab assignment that
    has 70% of the features fully implemented than to turn in an assignment that has 100%
    of the features partially implemented.
    <br>
    Final course letter grade will be determined using the following scale:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A >= 93</li>
        <li>A- 90-92.99</li>
        <li>B+ 87-89.99</li>
        <li>B 83-86.99</li>
        <li>B- 80-82.99</li>
        <li>C+ 77-79.99</li>
        <li>C 73-76.99</li>
        <li>C- 70-72.99</li>
        <li>D+ 67-69.99</li>
        <li>D 63-66.99</li>
        <li>D- 60-62.99</li>
        <li>F <60</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Course Policies: </b><br>
    Class attendance is required unless otherwise specified. During our
    class time we will remain focused on the topics at hand, avoid utilizing phones or email,
    and be inclusive of our fellow classmates.<br>
    <b>Changes to Course Assignments or Grades:</b><br>
    Changes to the course assignments or
    grades will be communicated through course lecture and/or Blackboard announcements.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>VIII. Practices and Policies during the Coronavirus Pandemic</h3>
    <p><b>Responsiveness to Change</b><br>
    Understanding that the COVID-19 pandemic could influence the course of this
    semester, Lewis University will be guided by our Lasallian mission and the wellbeing of our community of students, faculty, and staff in respond and adapting to
    any sudden changes or circumstances. Based on the guidance of the State of
    Illinois and the Centers for Disease Control, it may be necessary to change the
    planned modality this course.<br>
    <b>Flexibility, Accommodations, and Student Absences</b><br>
    Because we are committed to student success, the University community is
    committed to academic standards while maintaining flexibility and empathy.
    Absences relating to the Coronavirus crisis will be recognized as excused.
    Students experiencing disruptions in their lives related to the Coronavirus that
    impact class attendance and participation should contact their instructor and/or
    college Dean’s Office for assistance. Students directly impacted by Coronavirus
    will have the ability to request alternative grading this semester. Requests will be
    evaluated on a case by case basis and will require documentation.<br>
    Students who require academic accommodations due to disability caused by
    COVID-19, or to limit risk of exposure to Coronavirus, can engage in an
    interactive process with the Learning Access Coordinator to explore all avenues
    for accommodations. Students can contact the Academic Services office at 815-
    836-5593 or <a href="mailto:learningaccess@lewisu.edu">learningaccess@lewisu.edu</a> to request an appointment.<br>
    <b>Face Coverings, Physical Distancing, and Surface Cleaning</b><br>
    Face coverings are required in classrooms. Students will be expected to maintain
    physical distancing in the classroom (6 ft minimum) and to keep their nose and
    mouth covered at all times. Faculty will require students without face covering to
    obtain a disposable mask at the nearest University office providing them. While
    the University will disinfect classrooms and common spaces throughout the day,
    cleaning supplies will be provided in classrooms and offices so that students and
    faculty can wipe down work surfaces before class begins</p><br>
    <br>
    
    <h3>IX. Information for Students</h3>
    <p><b>Requests for Reasonable Accommodations</b>
    Lewis University is committed to providing equal access and opportunity for participation
    in all programs, services and activities. If you are a student with a disability who would        
    like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak with the Learning Access
    Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE). Please make
    an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing <a href="mailto:learningaccess@lewisu.edu">learningaccess@lewisu.edu</a>. Since
    accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is
    recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is
    not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor. For more
    information about academic support services, visit the website at:
    <a href="http://www.lewisu.edu/CASE">www.lewisu.edu/CASE</a>. <br>
    Lewis University has adopted Blackboard Ally providing alternative formats for files
    uploaded by instructors. Students can click the down arrow next to any file and select
    Alternative Formats.<br>
    <b>Sanctified Zone</b><br>
    Guided by its Catholic and Lasallian heritage, Lewis University is firmly committed to
    fostering a campus atmosphere that is permeated by its Mission values of Fidelity,
    Wisdom, Knowledge, Justice, and Association. Accordingly, we have declared the
    University campus to be a Sanctified Zone, a place and a people United in Diversity.
    The active promotion of diversity and the opposition to all forms of prejudice and bias are 
    a powerful and healing expression of our desire to be Signs of Faith (Signum Fidei) to
    each other. To learn more about the Sanctified Zone, please visit:

    <b>Academic Integrity</b><br>
    Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other
    forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the
    University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and
    expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially
    considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the
    instructor’s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level.
    Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the
    college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases
    except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the
    Provost makes the final decision.<br>
